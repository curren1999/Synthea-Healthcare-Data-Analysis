# Synthea Healthcare Data Analysis

This repository contains the documentation and outputs of a data cleaning and preparation task performed on **synthetic healthcare data generated using Synthea**. The datasets include patient-level information across domains such as personal details, medical encounters, allergies, medications, and diagnoses.  

The main objective was to **clean, structure, and standardize the datasets** to make them suitable for further analytical use.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
All five datasets from Synthea were successfully cleaned and standardized.  
- Unnecessary columns removed  
- Consistent naming conventions applied  
- Data types corrected  
- Duplicates removed  

The cleaned datasets are now **ready for exploratory analysis, dashboarding, and modeling**.  
Each step has been carefully documented to ensure **data consistency and integrity**.
